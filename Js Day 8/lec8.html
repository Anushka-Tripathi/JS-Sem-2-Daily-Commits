    Execution Context and Call Stack:
    <br>
    1. Global Execution Context
    <br>
       - (Creation Phase and Execution Phase)
    <br>
    2. Function Execution Context
    <br>
       - (Creation Phase and Execution Phase)
    <br>
    3. Call Stack
    <br>
       - Call Stack is a process and mechanism which keeps track of every process running in the background or js codes.
       - It stores Global Execution Context and Function Execution Context.
       - After the execution of code is over, it will first pop out the FEC, and then the GEC at the end.
       - It follows LIFO(Last In First Out) principle.
